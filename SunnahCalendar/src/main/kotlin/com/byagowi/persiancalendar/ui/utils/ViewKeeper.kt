/**
 * This relies on view ability to hold arbitrary objects, uses field name hash to cache
 * result of given lambda query from the view and calls 'bind' lambda lazily
 * when it misses view's cache.
 *
 * As it stores lambda's result inside the view's cache it doesn't need a clean up
 * on fragment's view lifecycle as the view itself will be purged along the cache store
 * and whenever the field is needed again and it misses the cache it will execute the
 * 'bind' lambda again.
 *
 * It is inspired from https://github.com/wada811/ViewBinding-ktx
